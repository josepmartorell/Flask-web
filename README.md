## Functionality implementation of a contact-form with Flask in a free template.

In this exercise, in a previous step, a free web template has been adapted to function as a Curriculum. For this, some functional characteristics have been incorporated (Lity - Lightweight, accessible and responsive lightbox) and logos and favicons have been recreated with Paint 3D.

In the final step, the project structure has been modified to incorporate functionalities into the contact form with Python (Flask).
